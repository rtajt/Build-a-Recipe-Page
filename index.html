    <h1>Apple Fritters Recipe</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name's JT, and I'm currently fastingright now (giving up sweets for 40 days). Luckily, I'm allowed to take
        a break every Sunday, and being able to cook one of my favorite sweets is really gonna help me get through it.
        Anyway, I hope you can enjoy it too!</p>
